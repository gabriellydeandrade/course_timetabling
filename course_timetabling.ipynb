The choice of these weights was obtained through experimentation and followed some basic principles: the DUMMY professor should be avoided, being used only when there is no other professor available to teach a course, in order not to make the model unfeasible. Therefore, its default value is close to zero $(0.0001)$. The weight of the professors follows a power of 10, so that substitute professors teaching service courses are generally preferred over permanent professors. In addition, the penalty for the professor not reaching the minimum workload is an institutional requirement. \n",
